# Homework 08 Elijah Willie

This repo contains my solutions to STAT 545 homework 08. For this assignment, I took a previously developed app and added some new functionalities.
These functionalities are described below.

# New features added

For this assigment, I added a few new features to the `BC liquor stores app`. Their descriptions can be found below.

* The results table has been made interactive.
* I have made separate tabs to display the plots and the tables.
* I have included the option to sort by price for the tables.
* I have included the option to pick a theme from a host of themes.
* I have include the `BC liquor stores` logo at the bottom of the page.

# Caveats
* Some of the work here may have been borrowed and modified from other sources.
* This was purely done to illustrate some ideas
* I take no credit for parts of the work that are not mine
* Let credit be given where it is due. Lets give to Ceasar what belongs to Ceasar
* The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).
